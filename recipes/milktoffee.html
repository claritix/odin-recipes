    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you have ever struggled to make Sri Lankan Milk toffee at home, 
        give this fool-proof recipe a try! It always makes delicious, 
        melt-in-your-mouth milk toffees.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Condensed milk cans - 15oz/397g each</li>
        <li>1 Cup Water </li>
        <li>400 g Sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract </li>
        <li>1/2 cup Chopped cashews (unsalted, roasted) (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Unsalted Butter at room temperature </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter the pan, cover with a parchment paper and apply butter again over the parchment paper. Also butter the knife and the spatula you're going to use.
or baking tray is fine, just make sure to shape the milk toffee mixture to a rectangular shape before it sets.</li>
        <li>Also cut the cashews into small pieces. If you're using raw cashews, dry roast slightly in a pan.</li>
        <li>Add condensed milk to a large pan. Add the water to the emptied cans, mix to dissolve any condensed milk that is left in the can. Then add that water to the pan. Also add sugar. Now turn on the heat and set it to <strong>medium-low. Stir continuously.</strong></li>
        <li>Keep stirring the mixture until all the sugar is dissolved and the mixture starts to bubble and turns into a thick syrup consistency and light brown. Add vanilla. Mix and continuously stir the syrup.</li>
        <li>You'll see that mixture turns thicker and thicker as you cook and it also turns darker in color. At the start of the cooking, when you drop the mixture from the spoon, it usually flows continuously.  As soon as it starts to fall in thicker, broken drops/paste rather than a steady ribbon like flow, it means the mixture has thickened enough. Now mix in your cashews and butter.</li>
        <li>Stir well until all the butter and cashews mix in with the milk toffee mixture. You'll see that the mixture becomes glossy, pulls away from the pan and turns into a pliable soft paste-like consistently.</li>
        <li>Now transfer the milk toffee mixture to your buttered baking pan. Using the buttered spatula, evenly spread the mixture and flatten it out.</li>
        <li>Cut them into square pieces (roughly about 1 inch - 1.5 inch depending on how big you want those pieces) while toffee mixture is still soft. Let it cool completely before removing the milk toffees from the tray and separate pieces.</li>
    </ol>
